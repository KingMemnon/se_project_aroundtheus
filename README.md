**Intro**
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. To fit as a responsive website between desktop, and mobile per figma, but also see usage in Tablet mode as well.
HTML, and CSS were used in creating this responsive website with the use of grid and flex box. As such I invested a lot more time in this project than previous ones combining what I had learned through the past 3 courses.
